      "full": "The **Cyclopes** (singular: Cyclops) are one-eyed giants from Greek mythology, characterized by a single large eye in the center of their forehead and enormous size and strength. Two distinct mythological traditions exist: 1. **Homeric Cyclopes**: Lawless, savage shepherds dwelling in caves and eating human flesh, most famously **Polyphemus** who was blinded by Odysseus 2. **Hesiodic Cyclopes**: Divine craftsmen (**Brontes**, **Steropes**, and **Arges**), sons of Uranus and Gaia, who forged Zeus' thunderbolts, Poseidon's trident, and Hades' helm of invisibility In later traditions, Cyclopes served as blacksmiths for Hephaestus, working in forges beneath volcanoes like Mount Etna."
