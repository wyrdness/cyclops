      "full": "The Cyclopes (singular: Cyclops) are one-eyed giants from Greek mythology, characterized by a single large eye in the center of their forehead and enormous size and strength. Two distinct mythological traditions exist: the Homeric Cyclopes are lawless, savage shepherds dwelling in caves and eating human flesh, most famously Polyphemus who was blinded by Odysseus; the Hesiodic Cyclopes (Brontes, Steropes, and Arges) are divine craftsmen, sons of Uranus and Gaia, who forged Zeus' thunderbolts, Poseidon's trident, and Hades' helm of invisibility. In later traditions, Cyclopes served as blacksmiths for Hephaestus, working in forges beneath volcanoes. Their single eye may have originated from ancient misinterpretation of dwarf elephant skulls, whose large nasal cavity resembles an eye socket."
